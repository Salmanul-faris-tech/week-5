Basics of Information Security

a. Learn the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.

Answer: Component

C - Confidentiality

Meaning

Keeping data private and accessible only to authorized people.

Example

Password protection, encryption, or two-factor authentication.

Real-life Scenario

A hospital encrypts patient records so only doctors and nurses can view them.

Component

I - Integrity

Meaning

Making sure information is accurate and not changed by unauthorized users.

Example

Hashing, checksums, digital signatures.

Real-life Scenario

A hacker tries to change your bank balance from ₹500 to ₹50,000 — integrity mechanisms detect and block the change.

Component

A - Availability

Meaning

Ensuring that authorized users can access data whenever they need.

Example

Backup servers, firewalls, and protection against DoS attacks.

Real-life Scenario

During an online sale, Amazon’s servers must stay up 24/7 so customers can buy products.

b. Explain what threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits are.

Answer: 
Threat

Anything that can harm data or systems.

Example

Hackers, malware, natural disasters, or careless employees.

Scenario

A hacker wants to steal customer credit card data from an e-commerce site.

Vulnerability

A weakness or flaw that a threat can exploit.

Example

Unpatched software, weak passwords, open network ports.

Scenario

The e-commerce site hasn’t updated its payment module — that’s a vulnerability.

Exploit

The method used by an attacker to take advantage of the vulnerability.

Example

Code injection, phishing, or brute force attacks.

Scenario

The hacker uses SQL Injection to steal data through the outdated module.

c. Research common security threats: malware, phishing, DoS attacks

Answer: 🦠 Malware (Malicious Software)

Meaning: Software designed to harm a computer or steal data.

Types: Virus, Worm, Trojan, Ransomware, Spyware.

Example: Ransomware locks your files and demands money.

Scenario: You download a “free movie player” app, but it installs ransomware. Your laptop screen shows: “Pay ₹10,000 to unlock your files.”

🛡️ Protection: Use antivirus software, don’t download from unknown sources, keep software updated.

🎣 Phishing

Meaning: Tricking someone into revealing sensitive data (like passwords or credit card details).

Example: A fake email from “your bank” asks you to log in.

Scenario: You get an email: “Your bank account is locked. Click here to verify.” The link leads to a fake site that steals your login credentials.

🛡️ Protection: Check sender addresses carefully, don’t click unknown links, use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

🌐 Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

Meaning: Flooding a server or network with too much traffic so legitimate users can’t access it.

Example: Attackers send millions of requests to a company website, making it crash.

Scenario: During an online exam, the university’s server is attacked by a DoS attack — students can’t access the portal.

🛡️ Protection: Use firewalls, load balancers, and rate-limiting tools to handle massive traffic spikes.
