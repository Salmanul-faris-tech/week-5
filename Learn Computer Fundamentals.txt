Learn Computer Fundamentals

a. Define basic computer components: CPU, memory, storage.

Answer: A computer is made up of three main internal components that work together just like the human body and brain.

1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The CPU is also called the Processor.

It’s the brain of the computer — every instruction you give goes through it.

It executes programs, performs calculations, and controls other components.

Main parts of CPU:

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) – performs math and logical operations

CU (Control Unit) – directs how data moves inside the system

Registers – small, super-fast memory spaces inside the CPU

📘 Example:
When you click “Play” on a video:

The CPU decodes the video data,

Directs it to memory, and

Sends output to the screen and speakers.

2. Memory (RAM)

Stands for Random Access Memory.

It’s temporary storage — it holds the data and programs that the CPU is currently using.

When you turn off the computer, everything in RAM is lost.

🧩 Example:
When editing a Word file, the text you type is stored in RAM until you save it.
Once saved, it moves to Storage.

3. Storage

This is permanent data storage, even when the computer is turned off.

Used for saving OS files, applications, music, videos, etc.

Types of Storage:

HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Mechanical, slower, cheaper

SSD (Solid State Drive): Faster, uses flash memory, no moving parts

External Storage: Pen drives, CDs, external hard disks

📘 Example:
When you install software or save a movie, it’s stored in the storage drive (HDD or SSD).

b. Understand what software and hardware are.

Computers have two main parts:

Hardware – Physical components you can touch

Software – The invisible instructions that make hardware work

Hardware

Definition: Physical, tangible parts of a computer.

Examples: Keyboard, Monitor, CPU, Mouse, Hard Disk, Motherboard.

🧠 Analogy: Hardware is your body — it performs actions but needs a brain (software) to guide it.

Software

Definition: A set of programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

You can’t touch software, but you can use it.

Types of Software:

System Software: Controls the computer (e.g. Windows, Linux, macOS)

Application Software: Performs specific tasks (e.g. Word, Chrome, Photoshop)

Utility Software: Maintenance tools (e.g. antivirus, file compression)

🧠 Analogy: Software is your brain and thoughts — it tells the body what to do.

c. Explain binary data and how computers store information

Answer:  Binary System (Base-2)

Computers do not understand English or numbers like we do.
They understand only two signals:

1 → ON (electric current present)

0 → OFF (no current)

These two digits form the binary system.

🧩 Example:

Decimal 2 = Binary 10

Decimal 5 = Binary 101

Decimal 10 = Binary 1010

Bits and Bytes

1 bit = smallest unit of data (can be 0 or 1)

8 bits = 1 byte

1 byte can represent a single character (like “A” or “B”)

How Computers Store Information

All data — text, images, videos, music — are converted into binary before storage.

Example:

Image → converted into binary pixel values

Music → converted into binary sound waves

Text → converted using ASCII or Unicode codes

Then, the data is stored on your hard drive or SSD as a long series of 0s and 1s.
