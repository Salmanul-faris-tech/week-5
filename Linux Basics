Linux Basics

a. Explain what Linux is and why it is used in cybersecurity.

Answer: Linux is an open-source operating system similar to Windows or macOS, but it’s free, customizable, and highly secure. It runs everything from servers and mobile phones (Android) to embedded systems.

Kernel → the core of Linux, managing hardware and system resources.

Distributions (Distros) → versions of Linux like:

Ubuntu (user-friendly)

Kali Linux (used in cybersecurity)

CentOS, Debian, Red Hat (for servers)

Why Linux is Used in Cybersecurity

Open Source: You can inspect and modify the system — transparency helps identify vulnerabilities.

Powerful Command Line (CLI): Tools like nmap, tcpdump, and metasploit work directly in Linux.

Security Control: Fine-grained control over permissions and users.

Server Dominance: Most web servers and cloud systems run Linux.

Tools Availability:

Kali Linux includes hacking and penetration testing tools.

Parrot OS, BlackArch, etc., are also built for ethical hackers.

🧩 Scenario Example:
A penetration tester uses Kali Linux to scan a company’s network with nmap for open ports, detect vulnerable servers, and report possible exploits — something much harder to do efficiently on Windows.

b. Learn basic Linux commands: navigation and file management.

Answer: 
🗂️ Navigation Commands
| Command | Description             | Example                                            |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `pwd`   | Print working directory | Shows your current directory → `/home/salman`      |
| `ls`    | List files and folders  | `ls -l` → detailed view (permissions, owner, date) |
| `cd`    | Change directory        | `cd Documents` → go to Documents folder            |
| `cd ..` | Go one directory up     | From `/home/salman/Documents` → `/home/salman`     |
| `clear` | Clear the terminal      | Removes previous outputs                           |

📘 Scenario:
You’re inside /home/salman/scripts but want to move to /home/salman/projects/security.

cd ../projects/security
pwd


Output → /home/salman/projects/security

📁 File Management Commands
| Command        | Description             | Example                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `touch`        | Create a new empty file | `touch report.txt`              |
| `mkdir`        | Create a new folder     | `mkdir logs`                    |
| `cp`           | Copy a file or folder   | `cp report.txt logs/`           |
| `mv`           | Move or rename a file   | `mv old.txt new.txt`            |
| `rm`           | Remove a file           | `rm temp.txt`                   |
| `rmdir`        | Remove empty folder     | `rmdir logs`                    |
| `cat`          | Display file contents   | `cat report.txt`                |
| `nano` or `vi` | Edit file content       | `nano script.sh`                |
| `find`         | Search for files        | `find /home -name "report.txt"` |

📘 Scenario:
You want to create a folder for your cybersecurity logs and move all .log files into it.

mkdir security_logs
mv *.log security_logs/
ls security_logs


You’ll now see all log files neatly organized.

c. Understand Linux file permissions and users.

Answer: 
1. Understanding Permissions
Each file in Linux has three types of permissions for three categories of users:
| Category     | Description                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `Owner (u)`  | The user who owns the file |
| `Group (g)`  | Users in the same group    |
| `Others (o)` | Everyone else              |

2. Permission Types
| Symbol | Meaning | Example                          |
| ------ | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `r`    | Read    | View the file                    |
| `w`    | Write   | Edit or delete the file          |
| `x`    | Execute | Run the file as a program/script |

Example output from ls -l:

-rwxr-xr--


Meaning:

Owner: read, write, execute (rwx)

Group: read, execute (r-x)

Others: read only (r--)

3. Changing Permissions and Ownership

| Command | Description        | Example                      |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `chmod` | Change permissions | `chmod 755 script.sh`        |
| `chown` | Change file owner  | `chown root:root secure.txt` |

🔸 Example Explanation:

chmod 755 script.sh means:

Owner → full access (7 = rwx)

Group → read + execute (5 = r-x)

Others → read + execute (5 = r-x)

🔒 Scenario:
A system admin wants only root to modify a security configuration file:

chown root:root firewall.conf
chmod 600 firewall.conf


Now only the root user can read/write it — others can’t even view it.

d. Practice simple command-line tasks.

Answer: 
🧩 Task 1: Navigation & File Creation
cd /home/user
mkdir cybersecurity
cd cybersecurity
touch notes.txt
echo "Linux is awesome!" > notes.txt
cat notes.txt
🧩 Task 2: Permissions
ls -l notes.txt
chmod 700 notes.txt
ls -l notes.txt

🧩 Task 3: Searching Files
find /home/user -name "*.txt"
🧩 Task 4: Simulate a Cybersecurity Scenario
cd /downloads
ls -l malware.sh
chmod 000 malware.sh
