Role of OS in Cybersecurity

a. Write how the OS helps protect data and system resources.

Answer: The OS protects data and system resources (CPU, memory, files, devices) through:

1. Access Control

The OS ensures that only authorized users can access files or applications.

Each file, process, and system component is given a permission level.

Example: Only the “admin” can install software; normal users can’t.

📘 Scenario:
In Windows, if a normal user tries to install a driver or delete a system file, a UAC (User Account Control) prompt appears asking for admin permission.
This prevents malware from silently modifying critical files.

2. Process Isolation

Each running program (process) operates in its own memory space, so one app can’t read or tamper with another.

This prevents malware from spreading or accessing sensitive data of other apps.

📘 Scenario:
A browser (like Chrome) runs each tab in a separate sandbox, so if one tab gets infected, others remain safe.

3. Encryption

The OS offers built-in tools to encrypt data stored on the device.

Encryption makes data unreadable to hackers without the correct key.

📘 Example:

Windows BitLocker, macOS FileVault, Linux LUKS — encrypt hard drives to protect data from theft.

4. System Integrity

The OS verifies that its own files and settings haven’t been tampered with.

Example: Secure Boot in Windows ensures the OS starts only with trusted software.

📘 Scenario:
When malware tries to replace a system boot file, Secure Boot blocks it and prevents startup with corrupted code.

b. Identify OS security features like authentication, permissions, and logging.

Answer: 1. Authentication

Confirms the identity of a user before granting access.

Common types:

Password-based login

Biometric login (fingerprint, face ID)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

📘 Example:
When logging into Windows or Linux, the OS verifies your username & password before giving access.

2. Permissions and Authorization

After authentication, the OS decides what actions the user can perform.

It defines read, write, and execute permissions for files or programs.

📘 Example:
Only the file owner can read, write, and execute the file — protecting it from others.

3. Logging and Auditing

The OS keeps security logs of user actions, system events, and access attempts.

These logs are vital for detecting and investigating suspicious activity.

📘 Example:

Windows Event Viewer logs failed logins.

Linux syslog and /var/log/auth.log show who logged in and when.

📘 Scenario:
If an attacker repeatedly tries wrong passwords, the OS logs it. The admin can detect brute-force attempts from the log files.

c. Give examples of OS security incidents and responses

Answer: Incident : Linux Server Privilege Escalation

A bug in Linux kernel allowed attackers to gain root (admin) access.

🛡️ OS Response:

Linux developers quickly released a patched kernel version.

Administrators used SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) to limit what even root users could do.
